Hi! My name is **Jinbo Wang** (**王锦波** in Chinese).

I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Computational Mathematics at [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Weinan E](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~weinan/) since 2022 and [Prof. Lei Wu](https://leiwu0.github.io/) since 2025.

My research lies at the intersection of large language model (LLM) and deep learning theory. Recently, I have focused on optimization methods for LLM pre-training and post-training, as well as theoretical studies on scaling laws.

I expect to graduate in 2027 and will be on the job market. Feel free to reach out!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
