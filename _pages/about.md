I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Computational Mathematics at [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Weinan E](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~weinan/) since 2022 and [Prof. Lei Wu](https://leiwu0.github.io/) since 2025.

My research bridges deep learning theory and large-scale LLM training. I study principled optimization methods, grounded in loss landscape g
eometry and scaling law analysis, to make LLM pre-training and post-training faster and more efficient. 
<!-- My recent work spans training acceleration via blockwise learning rates and gradient transformations, optimal batch size scheduling through functional scaling laws, and stabilization techniques for RLVR. My work has been published at **NeurIPS**, **ICML**, and **ICLR**. -->

I am expected to graduate in 2027 and will be on the job market soon. Feel free to reach out!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
